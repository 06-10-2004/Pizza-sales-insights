## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Created a new table pizza_single_ingredients by transforming the pizza_ingredients column:
   * Selected relevant columns: pizza_id, pizza_category.
   * Split the pizza_ingredients column into individual ingredients — one per row — to enable detailed ingredient-level analysis.
  
- Enhanced the pizza_sales table with time-based features to support temporal analysis:
  
  * order_hour: Extracted from the order timestamp to analyze peak sales hours.
  * order_month: Extracted to observe monthly sales trends.
  * order_day: Extracted to evaluate daily sales performance.
    
- Applied string manipulation and tokenization using `STRING_SPLIT()`.

## 🔍 Extended SQL Analysis (Own Questions)

In addition to basic metrics, I explored deeper questions such as:

- Most preferred order time?
- Highest & lowest-selling pizza categories?
- Total unique pizzas (by name + ingredients)?
- Which month has the most/least sales?
- Revenue contribution per month and day of the week?
- Most used ingredients?
- Most common pizza size?

> All insights were derived from handcrafted SQL queries without relying on pre-built reports or tools.
